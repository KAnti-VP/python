With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
print(x)
if x == "banana":
break

Output:
apple
banana

Task:
Create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20 but stops the loop when the number is 13.
