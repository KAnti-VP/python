Create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 but not the dividable by 3 in the following order:
Rools:
first do not print the first number dividable by 3,
secondly do not print the second number dividable by 3,
thirdly do not print the third number dividable by 3, and so on.

Output:
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, ...



Start to count divisible by 3
First skip the number 3
Again start counting. 6 is first and second is 9. By rule 2 skip 9.
Start again counting. First: 12, second: 15, third: 18. By rule 3 skip 18.
Continue with rule 1.
