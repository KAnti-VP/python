Create a program that gets a number and then prints a string based on the digits:
if zero, it writes o
if it is prime, it writes p
if it is even and not prime, it writes i
if it is one, it writes c
if greater than 4, odd, and not prime, then writes k

Use while loop.


Example:
Enter a number: 90741
